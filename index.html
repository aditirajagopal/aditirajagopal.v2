<h5 style="text-align:center">Thank you for visiting my website.</h5><br>
I graduated from University of Michigan College of Engineering in May 2014 with BSE in Computer Engineering, and a Certificate in Entrepreneurship. I currently work full-time for IBM, based out of Rochester, Minnesota. I used to work on the IBM Cloud Manager with OpenStack product as a Test Engineer, and now I work on Open Source Technologies (focusing on Docker). I am the Co-President of the Rochester Women's Network, a member of the New Hire Network Executive Board, and a core member of the Intern Co-Op Mentorship Program Planning Team. For more information (including my resume), please check out the "about me" page.<br><br>

I plan to update the 'portfolio' portion of this site every 6 months or so, and the 'blog' section more frequently. So feel free to poke around & see what I'm up to. If you would like to get in touch, feel free to message me on <a href = "http://linkedin.com/in/aditirajagopal">linkedin</a>, or on <a href = "https://twitter.com/Aditi_Rajagopal">twitter</a>.
