        <p>It’s midnight on November 5th 2015, and I’m staring at blank screen at www.hemingwayapp.com. My creative confidence is pretty low, and the day-light-savings continues to riddle my performance. I doubt that a cup of coffee is going to boost anything. All I want to do is sleep…and hope that this post writes itself. But here we are. Let me tell you my story.</p>

<h3 id="rewind-back-to-fall-term-2013">Rewind back to fall term 2013.</h3>

<p>It’s midterm season and I’m a senior at University of Michigan. The ultimate goal is two-fold: graduate &amp; land a full-time job. I applied to every company I could, and I was neck deep in work and extra curriculars. I interviewed with Jake Morlock (who is now my 2nd line manager) on October 11th 2013. After a 45 minute interview, I knew there was something special about him, and his team. Rochester Minnesota? Never heard of it. Doesn’t matter. Compared to all the other recruiters I had met, there was a distinct “IBM Difference” that felt right.</p>

<h3 id="people-always-saygo-with-your-gut">People always say…“Go with your gut.”</h3>

<p>I received my offer from IBM’s OpenStack Development team on October 29th 2013. I accepted the offer on November 21st 2013. Reading through my email archives is so unreal. I can’t believe it’s been 2 years already.</p>

<h3 id="ultimate-goal-achieved">2/2 - Ultimate Goal Achieved.</h3>

<p>I graduated from University of Michigan College of Engineering on May 4th 2014. My best friend and I split a can of red-bull before heading to commencement because we stayed up all night. In spite of all the trials and tribulations, we made it. Looking back on it, I can’t fathom how we did it; I’m just thankful that we did.</p>

<p>Soon after, I was on my way to India to volunteer with my SWE Collegiate section in Walchandnagar India. For 1 week, we hosted a 1 week STEM camp for 6-10th graders. The following week, we toured India’s Golden Triangle (Jaipur, Agra &amp; Dehli). It was an amazing experience. I hope to relive it’s essence through IBM’s Corporate Service Corps program.
Remember Rochester, Minnesota?</p>

<p>I made my first visit to IBM’s site in Rochester Minnesota on July 11th 2014. I remember sobbing the entire the drive from the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport to Rochester. My worst nightmare felt like it was coming true - I was moving to the middle of nowhere. But I got to meet Jake again; and I got to experience “Minnesota Nice” for the first time.  It was a bit reassuring.</p>

<p>The rest of July was a blur. Somehow, I ended up with a nice apartment, car, furniture, and a pretty slick ID lanyard. I started orientation on August 4th 2014 in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina. Peak summer and peak humidity. Unfortunately, I did not meet any IBMers who were going to be working in Rochester with me. Armed with my ThinkPad and my freshly minted IBM ID badge, I walked into the IBM Rochester Office on August 6th.</p>

<h3 id="it-was-a-pleasant-surprise---not-the-nightmare-i-had-thought">It was a pleasant surprise - not the nightmare I had thought</h3>

<p>It didn’t happen over night, but I found myself surrounded by some pretty amazing people:</p>

<ol>
  <li>He always scoffs when I say this to him, but I have the best office-mate a girl could have
<img src="/images/officemate.jpg" alt="OfficeMate" /></li>
  <li>I was on a team with two other new hires - both of which are smarter than me, but are willing to help me learn</li>
  <li>I have an incredible first-line manager who finds me opportunities (like this one) to exercise my creative skills. She is also supportive of my personal interests, and pushes me technically</li>
  <li>I have a large team of mentors ranging from age, experience, role, and business unit within IBM</li>
  <li>I have a group of wonderful friends at IBM who believe in me, and look out for me in their own unique ways</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="stay-tuned">Stay tuned.</h2>
