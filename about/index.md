My name is Aditi Rajagopal - pronounced [**/ah/dhi/thi**](http://www.forvo.com/word/aditi/) [**/rah/jah/go/paal**](http://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/rajagopal). 

My first name tends to be a bit tricky for a lot of people, so you can pronounce 'Aditi' as /ah/dee/tee if you'd like. No excuses on the last name though; I believe in you, just break it up phonetically. 

I am a first year IBMer working on Open Source Technologies (primarily contributing to Docker), a recent graduate of the University of Michigan College of Engineering, and a member of various committees on the Regional & National Levels of the Society of Women Engineers. I am also a freelance graphic designer & artist.

## Here are a few personal goals that I try to hold myself to everyday:

* Always try to be the type of teammate that I would choose for my own team -- this is not limited to my technical teams :)
* Always try to improve the environment that I am in so that it is better for any new-comers
* Always be surrounded by smart & supportive people 
* Always try to help others achieve their goals (including, but not limited to personal, technical & professional goals)

## Here are some inspirational quotes that resonate with me:
* "If something seems impossible, ask whether it's impossible or just unprecedented. Conquer the latter.""
* "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." - Albert Einstein

I am a dedicated professional that excels in the intersection of engineering & business. Through my intern, scholastic, extracurricular, non-profit, and full-time experiences, I believe that I have developed valuable combination of technical and business expertise. The aforementioned skills coupled with my ability to "learn on the fly" help me excel in the rapidly evolving tech field. 

I thrive in environments that push me out of my comfort zone, and require me to leverage my experience, technical chops, creativity, and perseverance. 

In a nutshell: I enjoy working hard, and I have fun while doing it :)
