During the summer of 2012, I had the opportunity to be the lead Front-End Developer 
and Designer for RePunch -- a customer loyalty mobile application. Initially, I
was brought on to the team as a front-end developer. By the end of the internship,
I was preparing content for the founder/CEO. This was a start-up of 5 individuals 
spread across the US. It was an interesting experience working with a 'client' 
that largely didn't know what they wanted in terms of site design, and graphic design.

Interestingly enough, this banner image was used with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/),
an Open Source image editing software. The RePunch guys used this banner image 
for their marketing/investment material for a while after I resumed being a 
full-time student. It is still being used on their [twitter page](https://twitter.com/repunchapp).

## Web Design

During my internship, I was in charge of mocking up website templates and implementing
them with django/html/css based on the wants/critiques/edits suggested by the remote team.
This is a screenshot of one of the webpages.
