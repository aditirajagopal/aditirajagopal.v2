The following are various freelance projects I have picked up along the way.

## Jillian's Bakery

Jillian Kimberlin is a friend of mine. During the December Holiday Season, she 
bakes and gives away dozens of [chocolate chip cookies](http://www.postbulletin.com/life/food/christmas-cookies-for-not-a-lot-of-dough/article_5cd174db-280e-53dd-abe8-1467e166966b.html). 
In order to make the process a bit easier for her, and to make the cookies extra
special, I created this logo, and got a rubber stamp made for her. 

## Pokeballers flag football jerseys

In Fall 2015, a bunch of the IBM new hires signed up for a flag football league.
Most of the guys are avid Pok√©mon fans, so I tried to incorporate it into the 
jersey design. All things considered, I should just stick with creating the jerseys
rather than participating on the field :)

## gEECS Logo Design

The Girls in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (gEECS) club at University
of Michigan wanted to refresh their logo. The clients wanted to maintain the 
integrity of the previous design (cursive 'g,' capital letters for 'EECS'). Based
on their wants, I created this logo -- it has been featured on t-shirts, various
presentations, and social media. 

## Actipal

From June 2012-December 2012, I worked with a Doctor at the University of Michigan
Department of Pediatric Endocrinology to create a mobile app to help kids with 
diabetes monitor their activity, blood sugar, insulin etc. This is one of the
many things I created for this project, but unfortunately, one of the few things
I still have. 

## Lynx Mobile App Site

In July 2012, a couple of undergrads approached me with a gig to create some 
website wireframes and mockups for a mobile app site. Considering their wants, 
this is the design I created for them. 

## Ross India Business Conference

In August 2012, a couple of grad students approached me with a gig to update 
their conference website. It was a wordpress site that needed to be further
customized to accomodate conference changes.
