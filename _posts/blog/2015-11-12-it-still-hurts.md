Self doubt is a tricky constraint. Growing up, my experiences taught me that I could tackle anything & everything I set my mind to. My pre-college & college experience taught me otherwise. But that's a story for another day. 

Graduating into the workforce has allowed me to unlock parts of the straight jacket of self doubt. In most cases, with a bit of hard work, and tenacity, I have been able to tackle some pretty sizable problems. 

## However...

Working with, and being continuously surrounded with smart people keeps me in the jacket. Some people claim that I'm just as smart & capable as everyone else, but it is hard for me to convince myself that this is true. 

## Sometimes I can.

I've gotten better at it, and I have gotten better at prolonging my time out of the jacket. Without being as plagued by self doubt. The absolute worst thing you can do is to remind me that the straight jacket exists. 

## Do you really want to hurt me?

Convince me to doubt myself. And I'll take care of the rest for you. 

I'll beat myself into a pulp and lock myself up in the straight jacket.
