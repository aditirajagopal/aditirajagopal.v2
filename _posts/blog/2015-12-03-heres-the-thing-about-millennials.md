## When you google "Millennials," here are a few of the top search results:

1. Millennials - Wikipedia: Millennials (also known as the Millennial Generation or Generation Y) are the demographic cohort following Generation X. There are no precise dates when the generation starts and ends; most researchers and commentators use birth years ranging from the early 1980s to the early 2000s. 
2. The "Millennials" Are Coming - CBS News
3. Do Millennials Make for Bad Employees? - The Atlantic
4. Millennials Gettng Help From Parents - The Atlantic
5. The Recession Generation - Forbes

## When you look at "Word Clouds" associated with Millennials, common keywords include:

1. Gadgets/Technology/Smart Devices/Internet
2. Underemployed
3. Impulsive
4. Instant Gratification
5. Savvy

These keywords can have both negative and positive connotations depending on the audience. From what I've seen, most articles written by "Non-Millennials" originate from two schools of thought:

1. Tenacious, social, inclusive, ambitious, educated, creative, etc
2. Lazy, entitled, too politically correct, hippies, disrespectful, highly opinionated, irresponsible with money, etc

## Fine. Whatever. 

Depending on the day, I exhibit all these qualities. For the most part, I can deal with these characterizations. All things considered, the one thing that we are particularly bad at is...

## Sitting Still. 

When people ask us to "be patient," or "wait for someone else," it drives us insane. When we see a problem, whether it be a bug in someone's code, or an inefficiency in a queue, or inaction in a workplace hierarchy, we want to fix it. The more we are asked to wait, and the longer it takes for us to get our hands on the problem, the faster we move from the 1st school of thought to the 2nd one.

Millennials, and every generation ahead of us, are more likely to throw caution to the wind to solve problems. We are more likely to step up to call out the problems in our society - whether it be on campus, in the work place, or on capitol hill.  

We are action driven & solution driven, and sometimes that gets us into trouble. Because a lot of times, we forget that there are situations in which we have to ask for permission.

## Could we be viewed as being "disrespectful," "impulsive" and "doing other people's jobs?" Yes. 

But it's our nature. We grew up on the instant gratification of technology. We grew up in schools that encouraged us to be "well rounded," and "jacks of all trades." If you think we are just going to sit still, and let problems continue to happen, you have another thing coming. We really don't like waiting around for someone to come up with a solution, or for issues to "go away." 

We will throw the hierarchy out the window if it means getting the job done, and the success of the team. We will rewrite your code, or our team's report if it sucks. We will start a conversation on campus about societal racism. We will redesign your logo, website, campaign, wardrobe, or even Point of View if it isn't current. We will call politicians out for their hypocrisy, regardless of what party they are associated with. We will force large tech companies to address gendered double standards. We will work around the clock to solve problems, and bring change to the world.

## We'll do it with technology, with fierceness, and with the hashtag #SorryNotSorry.

P.S. Quit comparing us to the "Next Generation"/"Gen Z"/Whatever. We are all more or less cut from the same cloth, and they are basically our younger siblings/younger cousins.
