Revamping this website was on my "To-Do" list for almost a year before I actually scrapped it. Overcommitting and my lack of creative confidence puts me in a vortex of procrastination. 

Side/Optional projects get hit the hardest. 

I'm a detail oriented perfectionist. So when it comes to these types of projects, if I'm not 100% happy, it's easy for me to scrap it and forget about it.

That's what happened to this blog. 

Till now. 

## Stay tuned.
